# point-counter

This project was created for badminton point counter.
There are 2 teams; blue team and red team.
Who is the first one that can get 11 points is the winner.
When both team get 10 point, we call that situation 'Due', the point will be reset to 0 for both team, the first one who can lead the other team for 2 points is the winner.
